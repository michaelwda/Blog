# NOTE: I've also wirrten a script that can perform most of the setup. See here: [Bash Script](rpi_bash)


Within the past year, I've had several customers ask me for digital signage solutions. I looked at commercial solutions for them, but they either 

- didn't have all the features they wanted or 
- were out of budget.


The main features the customers needed were

- HDMI - can be displayed on normal TVs bought from wherever
- Dynamic - information being displayed needs to be pulled from either internal systems or from user-defined input (WYSIWYG)
- Possibly have slideshows
- Cheap - Obviously there's development costs, but they don't want to spend $10k for a license of something and then have to pay maintenance or whatever else
- Ability to work across the wireless network

# The plan
After doing some research, thinking, and maybe some beers - I decided I would use a Raspberry Pi running linux that boots into Chrome Kiosk mode and loads a webpage. This webpage would then display whatever I wanted using HTML5/Javascript. 

# Hardware and Software
### Raspberry Pi
â€‹I went to Amazon and bought a Raspberry Pi 3 Kit that includes the case and memory card. Here's the one I bought: [CanaKit Raspberry Pi 3 Complete Starter Kit - 32 GB](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01C6Q2GSY)

### Raspbian Desktop - https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
Make sure you download the full desktop version, as weâ€™ll need to be launching Chrome in kiosk mode.

### Win32DiskImage - https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/

Iâ€™m not a big fan of installers, so I went and downloaded the -Binary.Zip file from the archive. This will let you run the application without having to install anything.
https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/files/Archive/

### SDFormatter - https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/
This is required for formatting as FAT

# Installing Raspbian
This is for directly installing Raspbian. You could probably achieve the same using NOOBS. If you were going to install a bunch of these devices, it would probably make sense to engineer a custom image, or possible use https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/pibakery/

1. Run SDFormatter and format your SD Card. This may not be strictly necessary, but it doesnâ€™t hurt.

2. Extract the Raspbian image. I use 7zip.

    ![](/static/rpi/7zip.png)

3. Run Win32DiskImage

4. Select the Raspbian image file you downloaded.

5. Select the drive of your SD card in the â€˜Deviceâ€™ dropdown. Make sure you chose the correct one. Otherwise, you risk damaging the data on your hard drive.
6. Select **Write** and wait for the process to finish. Thatâ€™s it!
7. Now you can plug the SD card into your Raspberry Piâ€™s slot.

# Setup Raspbian
1. Raspbian will boot automatically to the desktop.
2. Hook up a keyboard / mouse to interact
3. If you wish to set up wifi, you can do it using the GUI

# Update Packages

Open a terminal and type
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```

# Install Chromium

Open a terminal and type
```bash
sudo apt-get install chromium-browser
```

*It will likely already be the latest version*

# Fix the keyboard â€“ For whatever reason, my keyboard was set to GB.

Edit /etc/default/keyboard and change it from gb to us

Run: sudo reboot

# Install additional tools

Open a terminal and type
```bash
sudo apt-get install x11-xserver-utils unclutter
```

# Script the browser to start in kiosk mode

Run: `cd .config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/`

Run: `sudo nano autostart`

Add this line to the end
```bash
@chromium-browser â€“kiosk â€“no-first-run â€“disable-java â€“incognito https://yoururlhere
@xset s noblank
@xset s off
@xset -dpms
@unclutter -idle 0.1 -root
```

These lines will autostart the chromium browser and also prevent the pi from going to sleep.

# Set up a static IP

Run: `sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf`

Type in the following lines on the top of the file: `interface eth0 static ip_address=192.168.1.XX/24 static routers=192.168.1.1 static domain_name_servers=192.168.1.1`.

Run: `sudo reboot`

# Enable SSH

In terminal type: `sudo raspi-config`

First step should be to change your user password which should be option 2. The default username is pi and the default password is raspberry.

Once youâ€™ve changed your password head to option 8 â€“ Advanced Options and then option A4 â€“ SSH and just hit enabled.

SSH is now enabled, lets test it out. Head to another computer on the same network, if you are on a mac/linux computer you can do this next step from the terminal if you are a PC user however you will need to install a SSH program, my favorite being putty.

**Note:** These menu options have been moved around, just navigate around until you find them ðŸ™‚

# Wrapping up
At this point, you should have a fully-functional raspberry pi, with SSH, that you can configure to point to a website.

Next steps are to code a custom web app that dynamically displays data from a database/internal systems. I'll get into that in Part 2!
