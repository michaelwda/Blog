I've been intending to write this for a while, but twitter didn't really seem like the correct platform and I had let my blog languish, so I just left it alone for a while.

I fired someone by in November. It was decisive, within our 90-day probationary period, and I'm certain it was the right call. I walked into the office that day knowing what I had to do, knowing it needed to be done, and it was still just terrible all-around. The thing about it is, the blame can be placed on both sides of the table, but honestly I feel like it's more on my side. Lots of failures at all levels.

- Poor hiring. I had a whole rubric that I neglected because I personally like the guy. But when it came right down to it, there was a significant skills mismatch. 
- Lack of structure and support to assist getting him up to speed. I was constantly out of the office and not around to help.
- It took him by surprise. Clearly just a complete breakdown in communication on my part. 

Lots to take away from that experience, but mostly for me was that clear communication and expectations are key. I'm still working on it.
